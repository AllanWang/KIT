# KIT :retrofit

Exposes a global function, `createRetrofitApi`, that allows you to generate retrofit interfaces.

Without configs, only an interface and url are needed.
There are a bunch of other configs, available [here](https://github.com/AllanWang/KIT/blob/dev/retrofit/src/main/kotlin/ca/allanwang/kit/retrofit/RetrofitApi.kt), to add more functionality.
